## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I taught myself CSS Grid using Wes Bos's CSS Grid course and SASS on Educative. This was a great opportunity to apply the concepts in those courses on a project where I had to write the code from scratch.
